# Sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews

This Sentiment Analysis project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to classify the sentiment of movie reviews as positive or negative. Leveraging the IMDB dataset of 50,000 movie reviews, the model is trained to capture the context and emotional tone of each review, enhancing its ability to classify sentiments accurately. This application of natural language processing (NLP) and text analytics can help businesses understand audience sentiment, evaluate content reception, and improve decision-making based on public opinion. Future development could include deploying the model in applications to analyze real-time reviews and social media comments.
